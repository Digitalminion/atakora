# Documentation Coordination Plan

## Overview

This plan ensures 5 documentation agents (ella1-ella5) can work in parallel without conflicts while maintaining consistency across the Atakora codebase documentation.

## Agent Assignments

| Agent | Area | Files | Priority |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| ella1 | Core Framework & Synthesis | 90 | Highest - Others depend on core |
| ella2 | Resources & Constructs | 163 | High - Base for all resources |
| ella3 | CDK Infrastructure | 44 | Medium - Builds on resources |
| ella4 | CDK Application Services | 41 | Medium - Builds on infrastructure |
| ella5 | CLI & Supporting Systems | 77 | Low - User-facing, independent |

## Parallel Work Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation Phase
All agents work simultaneously on:
- **Public APIs first** - These are most critical
- **Complex algorithms** - Need detailed explanation
- **Core abstractions** - Foundation for understanding

### Week 2: Implementation Phase
Continue with:
- **Implementation details** - Private methods, helpers
- **Examples** - Add compilable examples
- **Cross-references** - Link related code

### Week 3: Polish Phase
Final improvements:
- **Review pass** - Check consistency
- **Missing links** - Add cross-references
- **Validation** - Ensure examples compile

## Handling Shared Dependencies

### Shared Types and Interfaces

When a type is used across multiple areas:

1. **Owner documents fully**: The package that defines the type provides complete documentation
2. **Consumers reference**: Other packages reference with @see tags
3. **Example**:
   ```typescript
   // In ella1's area (defines IStack)
   /**
    * Represents a CloudFormation stack.
    * [Full documentation here]
    */
   export interface IStack { ... }

   // In ella3's area (uses IStack)
   /**
    * Creates a network in the specified stack.
    * @param stack - The stack to add this network to
    * @see {@link @atakora/lib#IStack}
    */
   ```

### Cross-Package References

Use fully qualified references:
- `@see {@link @atakora/lib#ClassName}`
- `@see {@link @atakora/cdk/network#VirtualNetwork}`

### Import Documentation

Document why imports are needed:
```typescript
/**
 * Core framework types for construct definition.
 * Imported for base construct classes and lifecycle hooks.
 */
import { Construct, IConstruct } from '@atakora/lib';
```

## Conflict Prevention

### File Boundaries
- Each agent works in assigned directories only
- No overlap in file assignments
- Clear ownership boundaries

### Git Strategy
- Each agent creates a feature branch: `docs/ella1-core-framework`
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Daily pulls from main to stay synchronized

### Merge Order
Suggested merge order to minimize conflicts:
1. ella1 (core) - Foundation others may reference
2. ella2 (resources) - Base classes for CDK
3. ella3 & ella4 (CDK) - Can merge in parallel
4. ella5 (CLI) - Independent, can merge anytime

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Sync Points
- **Morning**: Check Asana for updates
- **Midday**: Update progress percentage
- **Evening**: Note any blockers

### Blocking Issues
If blocked by missing documentation from another agent:
1. Add comment in Asana task
2. Tag the blocking agent
3. Continue with other files
4. Use placeholder: `// TODO: Update reference after ella1 documents IStack`

### Questions and Clarifications
- **Technical questions**: Post in Asana task comments
- **Scope questions**: Reference ADR-004
- **Style questions**: Reference documentation-tasks.md

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Review Checklist
Before marking complete, each agent ensures:
- [ ] All public APIs documented
- [ ] Examples compile without errors
- [ ] Cross-references use correct syntax
- [ ] Gov vs Commercial differences noted
- [ ] No TODO comments remain

### Peer Review Process
After all agents complete:
1. ella1 reviews ella2 (resources use core correctly)
2. ella2 reviews ella3 & ella4 (CDK uses resources correctly)
3. ella5 reviews ella1 (CLI documents match core behavior)

### Final Validation
```bash
# Run documentation coverage
npm run docs:coverage

# Lint all documentation
npm run lint:docs

# Build documentation site
npm run docs:build

# Check for broken links
npm run docs:check-links
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- 100% public API coverage
- 90%+ total code coverage
- 0 documentation linting errors
- All examples compile

### Qualitative
- External contributor can understand code
- Design decisions are clear
- Azure concepts are explained
- Code purpose is evident

## Escalation Path

### Technical Issues
1. Check existing ADRs for guidance
2. Review similar files for patterns
3. Ask in task comments
4. Escalate to architect if needed

### Scope Issues
1. Reference ADR-004 for boundaries
2. Check documentation-tasks.md for details
3. Clarify in task comments
4. Adjust scope if needed with team agreement

## Timeline Checkpoints

### Day 3 Check-in
- Each agent should have 30%+ complete
- Public APIs should be done
- Any blockers identified

### Day 7 Check-in
- Each agent should have 70%+ complete
- Examples added
- Cross-references in progress

### Day 10 Completion
- 100% complete
- Self-review done
- Ready for peer review

### Day 12 Final
- Peer reviews complete
- All validation passing
- Documentation deployed

## Common Patterns

### Resource Documentation Pattern
```typescript
/**
 * Represents an Azure Virtual Network.
 *
 * A Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private
 * network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources to securely
 * communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
 *
 * @remarks
 * In Government clouds, VNets may have different available regions and
 * features. Always check the Azure Government documentation for specifics.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const vnet = new VirtualNetwork(stack, 'MyVNet', {
 *   addressSpace: ['10.0.0.0/16'],
 *   location: 'eastus'
 * });
 * ```
 */
```

### CLI Command Documentation Pattern
```typescript
/**
 * Deploys a stack to Azure.
 *
 * This command synthesizes the stack and deploys all resources to the
 * specified Azure subscription. It handles dependency ordering, validation,
 * and rollback on failure.
 *
 * @param stackName - Name of the stack to deploy
 * @param options - Deployment options
 * @returns Deployment result with resource IDs
 *
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * atakora deploy my-stack --subscription prod-sub
 * ```
 */
```

## Final Notes

Remember:
- Documentation is for future maintainers
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Include context and rationale
- Think like an external contributor
- Make the implicit explicit

This documentation effort will significantly improve the maintainability and accessibility of the Atakora codebase.
