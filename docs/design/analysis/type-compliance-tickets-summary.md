# CDK Type Compliance - Tickets Created Summary

## Overview

Following the comprehensive architectural analysis of CDK resource type usage, the following tickets have been created to address non-compliance issues and establish enforcement mechanisms.

## Tickets Created

### High Priority

   - Assigned to: Devon
   - Impact: Core networking infrastructure
   - File: `packages/cdk/src/network/virtual-network-types.ts`

2. **[1211631607015935] Fix: Diagnostic Setting types not using schema imports**
   - Assigned to: Devon
   - Impact: Critical monitoring infrastructure

3. **[1211631609192132] Generate missing schema types for CDK resources**
   - Assigned to: Felix
   - Impact: Blocks several type compliance fixes
   - Scope: Management Groups, Azure Functions, Action Groups, etc.

4. **[1211631737956533] Implement type usage enforcement mechanisms**
   - Assigned to: Charlie
   - Impact: Prevents future non-compliance

   - Assigned to: Devon
   - File: `packages/cdk/src/network/private-dns-zone-types.ts`

6. **[1211631603350815] Fix: Private Endpoint types not using schema imports**
   - Assigned to: Devon
   - File: `packages/cdk/src/network/private-endpoint-types.ts`

7. **[1211631736691003] Fix: Resource Group types should check for schema imports**
   - Assigned to: Devon
   - File: `packages/cdk/src/resources/resource-group-types.ts`

8. **[1211631606475519] Fix: Storage Queue types not using schema imports**
   - Assigned to: Devon
   - Files: `packages/cdk/src/storage/queue-service-types.ts`, `queue-types.ts`

## Additional Tickets Needed (Not Yet Created)

The following resources also need tickets but were not created in this batch:

- Virtual Network Link types (`virtual-network-link-types.ts`)
- Action Group types (`action-group-types.ts`)
- Azure Function types (`azure-function-types.ts`)
- Management Group types (`managementgroups/management-group-types.ts`)
- API Management Backend types (`apimanagement/rest/backend-types.ts`)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Schema Generation (Week 1)
- Felix to audit and generate missing schema types
- Establish schema generation pipeline

### Phase 2: High Priority Fixes (Week 1-2)
- Devon to fix Virtual Network and Diagnostic Settings
- These are critical infrastructure components

### Phase 3: Medium Priority Fixes (Week 2-3)
- Devon to fix remaining network and storage resources
- Ensure consistency across related resources

### Phase 4: Enforcement (Week 3-4)
- Charlie to implement automated checks
- Prevent regression to non-compliant patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Immediate**: 11 non-compliant files remediated
- **Short-term**: 100% of CDK types using schema imports where available
- **Long-term**: Zero new non-compliant types through enforcement
