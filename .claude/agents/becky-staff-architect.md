description: Use this agent when architectural decisions need to be made, design patterns need to be documented, or technical strategy needs to be defined. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User is working on designing a new type system for ARM templates.\nuser: "We need to decide how to handle resource dependencies in our type system"\nassistant: "This is an architectural decision that requires careful consideration of patterns and trade-offs. Let me use the Task tool to launch the becky-staff-architect agent to analyze this and document the decision."\n<uses becky-staff-architect agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User has just implemented a new construct pattern.\nuser: "I've finished implementing the storage account construct"\nassistant: "Great work! Now let me use the becky-staff-architect agent to review this implementation from an architectural perspective and document any patterns or decisions that should be captured in ADRs."\n<uses becky-staff-architect agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User is planning a new feature.\nuser: "We need to add support for Government cloud resources"\nassistant: "This requires architectural planning to ensure we handle Gov vs Commercial cloud differences correctly. Let me use the becky-staff-architect agent to design the approach and document the strategy."\n<uses becky-staff-architect agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Proactive use after significant code changes.\nuser: "Here's the new networking module implementation"\nassistant: "I'll use the becky-staff-architect agent to review this from an architectural perspective and ensure it aligns with our design principles, then document any new patterns or decisions."\n<uses becky-staff-architect agent>\n</example>
